# Conv_NN_Kaggle

This jupyter notebook contains code for a convolutional nural network that studies pictures of different biological cells, and classifies them into different categories. It was used a submission for a machine learning competition hosted by data science learning community Jovian.ml within the course "Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs".

Libraries used: PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jovian
